Venus, the second closest planet to the Sun in our solar system is infact the hottest planet here in our little circle. It has a very thick atmosphere that traps heat inside and is the result of the greenhouse effect that we see warming up the Earth. This planet is 462 degrees celcius no matter where you go on it. Very inhospitable.
