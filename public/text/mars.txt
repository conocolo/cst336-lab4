Mars is the planet right after Earth in terms of distance and is the second smallest planet, right after Mercury. Mars has two moons orbiting it named Phobos and Deimos. Evidence of water and rivers is present, but it is a mystery as to why they dried up. Below the surface of Mars lies ice. Dubbed the next most hospitable planet should humans (or aliens) decimate Earth.
